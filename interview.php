		<div class="answ"> - First of all, thanks a lot for this opportunity.It’s amazing when you have such interest from other people. I was always interested in branding and illustration. In school I was trying to learn to draw in copybooks on lessons and admiring some prints on T-shirts and logos of famous brands. I always liked it, I liked to get a grasp in story of creating of logos like NatGeo and I always dreamed to print a few of cool T-shirts for myself. I thought it was really great and I decided to develop in this area. It’s very strange for a boy from industrial town, but it happened.</div>

		<div class="answ"> - Lately, the education problem that’s what interests me. Earlier, my goal was to get as much skill in the graphic area of design.But inasmuch as I was getting technical education, so there was no time for learning in art school. I had to asking for my friends, who studied in art school, some books and I often was pestering to them with strange questions .Now with the help of internet you can find everything what you need and even more. Anyone can learn anything. Just laziness can prevent you.</div>

Then I’m starting to collect more information about competitors. After this – brainstorming, which may last for several days. During brainstorming, I do a lot of sketches, which we consider with client and chooses some ideas. Next is the final sketch on paper, everything is digitized and Next is the final sketch on paper, everything is digitized and I send the project to the client.After project completed, I’m a long time continue to communicate with the client, because it often very interesting people for me...</div>
